# NLW Return 2022
Project was developed during the NLW Return 2022, an event from Rocketseat. For me, the main objective of this event was to learn React, so I prefered to do only the frontend. In the future, I pretend to refactor this project adding the backend in Nodejs and also mobile using React Native.

In addiction to the content of the classes, I also refactored the project adding three anothers items:

#### 1 - It was created a new component 'WidgetHeader', which received a title as a property.
#### 2 - It was created a new component 'WidgetFooter'.
#### 3 - In all components, the project was built using styled components with tailwind, which helps in clean code.

## Start the project

### 1 - Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
### 2 - After clone the project, you need to install all the dependencies. On the main folder named by 'nlw-return-web', run this command: npm install
### 3 - On the same folder, run this command: npm run dev
