# NLW Return
Project was developed during the NLW Return 2022, an event from Rocketseat. For me, the main objective of this event was to learn React, so I prefered to do only the frontend. In the future, I pretend to refactor this project adding the backend in Nodejs and also mobile using React Native.

## Start the project

### 1 - Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
### 2 - After clone the project, you need to install all the dependencies. On the main folder named by 'nlw-return-web', run this command: npm install
### 3 - On the same folder, run this command: npm run dev
